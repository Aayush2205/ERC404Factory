Among other access patterns, it can be used to implement efficient LIFO and FIFO queues. Storage use is optimized, and all operations are O(1) constant time. This includes {clear}, given that the existing queue contents are left in storage. The struct is called `Uint256Deque`. This data structure can only be used in storage, and not in memory. ```solidity DoubleEndedQueue.Uint256Deque queue; ```",
